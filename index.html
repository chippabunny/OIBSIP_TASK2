              when revenues and profits grew less than predicted. Forstall's resignation was widely seen as a dismissal,
               allegedly caused by Cook's desire to reduce "rivalries between executives"and drew criticism, 
              as Forstall had been seen as a possible successor to Cook. On February 28, 2014,
               Cook made headlines when he challenged shareholders to "get out of the stock" 
               if they did not share the company's views on sustainability and climate change.
               In May 2016, Cook traveled to China to meet with government officials there after the closure 
               of Apple's online iTunes Store and Apple Books store by the Chinese government
